My name is Onuray. I am a senior business student in university and doing double major with Psychology.
I am taking this class to learn R program because I am deeply interested in consumer behavior and psychology of marketing. Therefore acknowledge of R program would allow me turn data about my target group of customers, to information and strategies which I can use as a development of a business solution.
